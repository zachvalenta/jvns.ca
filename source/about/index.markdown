### About this blog

This blog was once [described](danluu.com/programming-blogs/) as

>AFAICT, the theme is “things Julia has learned recently”, which can be anything from [Huffman coding](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/02/22/how-gzip-uses-huffman-coding/) to how to be happy when working in a remote job. When the posts are on a topic I don’t already know, I learn something new. When they’re on a topic I know, they remind me that the topic is exciting and contains a lot of wonder and mystery.

> Many posts have more questions than answers, and are more of a live-blogged exploration of a topic than an explanation of the topic.

This blog is about

* being delighted about programming.
* ZINES. well at least a little bit. I wrote [a zine about strace](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/04/14/strace-zine/) and if you read it, it would make my day.
* making technical topics easy to understand ([TCP!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/) [Kernel hacking!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/01/04/4-paths-to-being-a-kernel-hacker/) [Traceroute!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/31/day-20-scapy-and-traceroute/) [gzip!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/) [databases!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-pages/))
* [asking questions and getting better every day](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/13/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/).
* how being clear & EXCITING is more important than sounding smart
* feelings, occasionally ([Programming doesn't belong to men (it belongs to me)](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/12/28/programming-doesnt-belong-to-men-it-belongs-to-me/), [why I don't feel guilty about not contributing to open source](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/26/i-dont-feel-guilty-about-not-contributing-to-open-source/))
* being a wizard. I wrote a guide to [how to be a wizard programer](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/638365065926811648). it's like 3 steps but it takes probably 20 years.

There's an occasionally-updated [list of favorite posts](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/favorite/).

If you want to comment on a blog post I write, I'll see it fastest if you [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/b0rk).

Thank you for reading ❤.

### About me

I live in Montreal. I work at Stripe, on infrastructure. I read all my email and try to respond. I sometimes give [talks](http://jvns.ca/talks). People say they really like my talks because I am so enthusiastic in them.

I have one main opinion about programming and it's -- understanding the underlying systems you use (the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you're running on top of) is essential if you want to do amazing work and be able to fix hard problems. It's served me well so far.

My happiest internet accomplishment to date is that someone gave out my strace zine to their operating systems class and tweeted a picture at me. omg.

I spent the fall of 2013 at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), which
houses the best programming community I've seen anywhere. I wrote down [what I
did every day while there](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/), if you want to know what it's like.
