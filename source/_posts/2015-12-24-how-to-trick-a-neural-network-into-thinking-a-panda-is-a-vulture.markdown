I have an article published in Code Words, the Recurse Centre quarterly publication! I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. It comes with code so that you can reproduce everything in it yourself!

Here it is: [How to trick a neural network into thinking a panda is a vulture](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/why-do-neural-networks-think-a-panda-is-a-vulture)

Code Words is overall pretty excellent -- you can find [every past article here](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues). I particularly like [DDoS and you](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/ddos-and-you) and [Git from the inside out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out) which taught me a lot about Git internals. Also, [When is equality transitive?](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/one/when-is-equality-transitive-and-other-floating-point-curiosities) is delightful.
