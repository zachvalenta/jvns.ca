The wonderful [Sumana Harihareshwara](http://www.harihareswara.net/)
recently tweeted that she released her talk
[A few Python Tips](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1329) as
CC-BY. I thought this was a super cool idea!

After all, if you've put in a ton of work to put a talk or workshop
together, it's wonderful if other people can benefit from that as much
as possible. And none of us have an unlimited amount of time to give
talks.

Stephanie Sy, a developer in the Phillippines, emailed me recently to
tell me that she used parts of my
[pandas cookbook](http://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook/) to run a
[workshop](http://devcon.ph/events/python-code-camp). IN THE
PHILIPPINES. How cool is that? She put
[her materials online, too!](http://stefsy.com/pandas_devcon/).

So if you want to give a talk about how to do data analysis with
Python, you too can reuse these materials in any way you see fit! You
can get materials for talks I've given on
[this page of talks](http://jvns.ca/talks/). Just attribute me, and
maybe tell me about it because THAT WOULD BE COOL :)

In other open source talks news,
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) also has
MIT-licensed lesson materials! Want to give an novice introduction to
git? Go to
[the SWC bootcamp respository](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc) and
look in
[novice/git](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/master/novice/git)!
They even take pull requests.
