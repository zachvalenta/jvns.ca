title: "How I got a CS degree without learning what a system call is"

Yesterday I wrote that I have 2 CS degrees but didn't know what a system call
was when I graduated. Some people think this is surprising and a failure of CS
education.

I don't have any opinions really about what a CS education should  be, but, to
explain how this happened, I wrote down a while ago all the classes I took in
my joint math/CS undergrad. The math & CS theory classes at my university were
extremely good, so I just took all of them.

This is just to say that "a CS degree" can represent a lot of different
educations, and personally I think that's totally fine. I know people who
mostly did electrical engineering and human computer interaction! Took a ton
of biology classes because they were studying bioinformatics!

But more importantly -- it's ok to not know things. I knew practically nothing
about a lot of really important programming concepts when I got out of grad
school. Even though I'd started learning to program 8 years before! Now I know those
things! I learned them.

I have friends who are amazing programmers who sometimes feel bad because they
don't have a CS degree and sometimes don't know algorithms/CS theory stuff
that other people know. They've learned the things they needed to know! They
are great.

Here's the list.

### grad school

I had to take 6 classes during my master's. They were:

* Higher Algebra 1
* Geometry & Topology 1
* Geometry & Topology 2
* Machine Learning	
* Topics in Computer Science (lie algebras)
* Advanced Topics Theory 2 (I don't remember the topic right now)
