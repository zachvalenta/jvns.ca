## Systems programming as a swiss army knife (PyCon 2015)

**Abstract**: You might think of the Linux kernel as something that only kernel developers need to know about. Not so! It turns out that understanding some basics about kernels and systems programming makes you a better developer, and you can use this knowledge when debugging your normal everyday Python programs.

## Opening statements: PyCon 2015

In which [I very excitedly welcome everyone to the conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_H6JpkgM8s). this was the first time I spoke in front of more than 1000 people and it was super fun.

## You can be a kernel hacker! (Strange Loop 2014)

<strong>
[Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com), September 2014
</strong>

**Abstract**: Writing operating systems sounds like it's only for wizards, but
it turns out that operating systems are written by humans like you and me. I'm
going to tell you what a kernel is and why you should care. Then we'll talk
about a few concrete ways to get started with kernel hacking, ranging from the
super-easy to the terrifyingly difficult.

<strong>
[!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com), May 2014
</strong>

In which I am EXTREMELY EXCITED about explaining how to use strace to
debug your code.
