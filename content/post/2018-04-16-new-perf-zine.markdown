Hello! I'm delighted to announce that today I'm releasing a new zine: Profiling & tracing with
perf!!

`perf` is one of my favorite programs for profiling / tracing Linux programs and SO MANY people
don't know about it and don't know how it works. So this zine aims to fix that, as usual :)

### how these zines are funded

A quick note on funding!! I decided a while back that giving away zines 100% for free wasn't working
for me. Making them is a lot of work! So I came up with a new plan.

The way it works now is -- when I release a new zine, I'll put it up for sale ($10 for the PDF) if
you want early access. Then after 2-3 weeks or so, I'll put it up on this website for free. I used
to have donation links on my zines page but nobody really used them so I don't do that anymore :)

So I put this perf zine up for sale a few weeks ago, 250 of you bought early access to the zine
(thank you!!) and I feel great about that. And today I'm releasing it for free so that everyone else
can read it too!
