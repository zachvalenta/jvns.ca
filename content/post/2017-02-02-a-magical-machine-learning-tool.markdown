Today I learned about a really cool machine learning art tool!!

It is called "paintschainer" and it lets you colour in black and white
images! 

The github repo is at
[https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer](https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer)
and you can try it out yourself at
[http://paintschainer.preferred.tech/](http://paintschainer.preferred.tech/). It seems to be by [this Japanese company](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/ja/).

Here is my favorite thing I used it for so far: (before & after). This is a
picture of me from the networking zine cover that [liz](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie) drew.

</div>

I also coloured in the whole cover of the networking zine as an experiment.
It also made me happy but didn't come out quite as awesome. Someone on twitter [described](https://twitter.com/nabijaczleweli/status/827301893252734976) this as "Confused Girl In Orange Hoodie
Finds LSD, Hallucinates Purple Cat, Becomes Networking Genius" which I
think is probably about right.

### machine learning art tools & making something that feels like I made it

This made me think about what kinds of machine learning art tools I find
compelling / exciting. I am not very good at a lot of technical art
things yet -- I can't do shading, I don't really know how to colour
something in. I can't draw a cartoon animal without following a
tutorial.

**[deepart.io](https://deepart.io/)** lets you take a photo and redraw it
in the "style" of another painting. I thought [this example](https://deepart.io/img/OhtbfXRb/) was really cool. It takes a
pretty ordinary photograph, combines it with a painting, and gives you
something really cool looking!

I spent a bunch of time playing with deepart.io but couldn't make
anything I really was excited about. My current hypothesis is -- I want to use magical art
tools to make things that feel like **I** made them.

### tablets & tracing

While we're talking about art tools and technology that enables you to
do something cool -- I
bought a 10 inch Android tablet in September, which is what I use to
draw all my zines / programming drawings. Another fun thing I very
occasionally do with it is to take photos and then trace them into sketches.

This one is a house a few blocks away from where I live.

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/stairs.png" width=300px>
</div>

This is dramatically better than my usual house drawing skills. Here is
what it usually looks like when I draw a house freehand:

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/terrible-house.png" width=200px>
</div>

I wondered what this would look if I coloured it with the magical
colouring tool paintschainer. It's kind of cool!

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/stairs_coloured.jpg" width=400px>
</div>

I find this really cool because I can make an image with my hands (I
drew all the lines in that image!) with a lot less skills than I would
have needed without this magical technology. And it feel more like a
thing that _I_ made because I have a lot of creative control over what
it looks like (I took the original photo, I decided what to trace, and I
picked the colours to colour it in with).

### a very short listing of magical art tools

* a tablet that you can use to trace photos with
* [deepart.io](https://deepart.io) (and this paper: [a neural algorithm of artistic style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). [github repo](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style))
* [deep dream generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/) ("add dogs & creepy eyes to anything!")
* [paintschainer](http://paintschainer.preferred.tech) (what I used for
  the images in this post)
* This cool ["realistic image manipulation"](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~junyanz/projects/gvm/) paper has some nice videos (but you don't appear to be able to use it)

if you know about more tools like this I would like to hear about them!
This kind of thing is probably the application of neural networks that
makes me the most excited.
