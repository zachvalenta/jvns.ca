The talk recordings and transcripts for the amazing talks at !!Con
have been posted! Go learn about EEG machines, how to stay in love
with programming, type theory, dancing robots, hacking poetry, and more!

[Here they are](http://bangbangcon.com/recordings.html)!!

[Erty Seidel](http://ertyseidel.com/) did pretty much 100% of the work
for the talk recordings. Super pleased with the results.
