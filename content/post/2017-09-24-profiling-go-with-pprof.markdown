Last week me and my cool coworker Josh were debugging some memory problems in a Go program using [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/).

There's a bunch of pprof documentation on the internet but I found a few things confusing so here
are some notes so I can find them easily.

First -- when working with pprof it's good to be running a recent version of Go! For example Go 1.8
adds [mutex profiles](https://rakyll.org/mutexprofile/) so you can see mutex contention.

in this post I'll

* link to the useful pprof resource I found
* explain what a pprof profile is
* give an example of how to look at a heap profile of a Go program
* most importantly (to me), deconstruct an example pprof protobuf file so we understand what a pprof profile
  actually is

This post won't really explain in detail how to to use pprof to diagnose performance issues in Go
programs, but I think these fundamentals ("what even is a pprof file") will help me do that more
easily.

### pprof basics

pprof lets you collect CPU profiles, traces, and heap profiles for your Go programs. The normal way
to use pprof seems to be:

1. Set up a webserver for getting Go profiles (with `import _ "net/http/pprof"`)
2. Run `curl localhost:$PORT/debug/pprof/$PROFILE_TYPE` to save a profile
3. Use `go tool pprof` to analyze said profile

You can also generate pprof profiles in your code using the [`pprof` package](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/) but I haven't done that.  

### Useful pprof reading

Here is every useful link I've found so far about pprof on the internet. Basically the material on
the internet about pprof seems to be the official documentation + rakyll's amazing blog.

* Setting up a pprof webserver: https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/
* Generating pprof profiles in code: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/
* https://github.com/google/pprof (from which I found out that `pprof` can read perf files!!)
* The developer docs: https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/pprof.md
* The output of `go tool pprof --help` (I pasted the output on my system [here](https://gist.github.com/jvns/6deaa10500f375a8581a06da8d8a967b))
* [@rakyll](https://twitter.com/rakyll)'s blog, which has a huge number of great posts about pprof: https://rakyll.org/archive/. In particular [this post on custom pprof profile types](https://rakyll.org/custom-profiles/) and [this on the newish profile type for seeing contended mutexes](https://rakyll.org/mutexprofile/) are great.

(there are probably also talks about pprof but I am too impatient to watch talks, that's part of why
I write lots of blog posts and give few talks)

### What's a profile? What kinds of profiles can I get?

When understanding how things work I like to start at the beginning. What is a "profile" exactly?

Well, let's read the documentation! The 7th time I looked at [the runtime/pprof docs](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/), I read this very useful sentence:

> A Profile is a collection of stack traces showing the call sequences that led to instances of a
> particular event, such as allocation. Packages can create and maintain their own profiles; the most
> common use is for tracking resources that must be explicitly closed, such as files or network
> connections.

> Each Profile has a unique name. A few profiles are predefined:

```
goroutine    - stack traces of all current goroutines
heap         - a sampling of all heap allocations
threadcreate - stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads
block        - stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives
mutex        - stack traces of holders of contended mutexes
```

There are 7 places you can get profiles in the default webserver: the ones mentioned above

* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine
* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/threadcreate
* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/block
* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/mutex

and also 2 more: the CPU profile and the CPU trace.

* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile
* http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5

To analyze these profiles (lists of stack traces), the tool to use is `go tool pprof`, which is a bunch of
tools for visualizing stack traces.

**super confusing note**: the trace endpoint (`/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5`), unlike all the rest, outputs a file that is **not** a
pprof profile. Instead it's a **trace** and you can view it using `go tool trace` (not `go tool pprof`). 

You can see the available profiles with http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/ in your browser. Except
it doesn't tell you about  `/debug/pprof/profile` or `/debug/pprof/trace` for some reason.

All of these kinds of profiles (goroutine, heap allocations, etc) are just collections of
stacktraces, maybe with some metadata attached. If we look at the [pprof protobuf definition](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/proto/profile.proto), you see that a profile is mostly a bunch of `Sample`s.

A sample is basically a stack trace. That stack trace might have some extra information attached to
it! For example in a heap profile, the stack trace has a number of bytes of memory attached to it. I
think the Samples are the most important part of the profile.

We're going to deconstruct what **exactly** is inside a pprof file later, but for now let's start by
doing a quick example of what analyzing a heap profile looks like!

### Getting a heap profile with pprof

I'm mostly interested in debugging memory problems right now. So I decided to write a program that
allocates a bunch of memory to profile with pprof.

```
func main() {
    // we need a webserver to get the pprof webserver
    go func() {
        log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
    }()
    fmt.Println("hello world")
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    go leakyFunction(wg)
    wg.Wait()
}

func leakyFunction(wg sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    s := make([]string, 3)
    for i:= 0; i < 10000000; i++{
        s = append(s, "magical pandas")
        if (i % 100000) == 0 {
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

Basically this just starts a goroutine `leakyFunction` that allocates a bunch of memory and then
exits eventually.

Getting a heap profile of this program is really easy -- we just need to run `go tool pprof  http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap`. This puts us into an interactive mode where we run `top` 

```
$ go tool pprof  http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
    Fetching profile from http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
    Saved profile in /home/bork/pprof/pprof.localhost:6060.inuse_objects.inuse_space.004.pb.gz
    Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
(pprof) top
    34416.04kB of 34416.04kB total (  100%)
    Showing top 10 nodes out of 16 (cum >= 512.04kB)
          flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
       33904kB 98.51% 98.51%    33904kB 98.51%  main.leakyFunction
```

I can also do the same thing outside interactive mode with `go tool pprof -top  http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap`.

This basically tells us that `main.leakyFunction` is using 339MB of memory. Neat! 

We can also generate a PNG profile like this: `go tool pprof -png  http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > out.png`.

Here's what that looks like (I ran it at a different time so it's only using 100MBish of memory).

### pprof fundamentals: deconstructing a pprof file

When I started working with pprof I was confused about what was actually happening. It was
generating these heap profiles named like `pprof.localhost:6060.inuse_objects.inuse_space.004.pb.gz`
-- what is that? How can I see the contents?

Well, let's take a look!! I wrote an even simpler Go program to get the simplest possible heap
profile.


```
package main

import "runtime"
import "runtime/pprof"
import "os"
import "time"

func main() {
    go leakyFunction()
    time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
    f, _ := os.Create("/tmp/profile.pb.gz")
    defer f.Close()
    runtime.GC()
    pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f);
}

func leakyFunction() {
    s := make([]string, 3)
    for i:= 0; i < 10000000; i++{
        s = append(s, "magical pprof time")
    }
}
```

This program just allocates some memory, writes a heap profile, and exits. Pretty simple. Let's look
at this file `/tmp/profile.pb.gz`! You can download a gunzipped version `profile.pb`
[here: profile.pb](https://gist.github.com/jvns/828b5b99d3d7c875175c1e8a1d832161/raw/fc90af99da22bd7b4d444aa516c3d495f289d94b/profile.pb). I installed protoc using [these directions](https://gist.github.com/sofyanhadia/37787e5ed098c97919b8c593f0ec44d8).

`profile.pb` is a protobuf file, and it turns out you can view protobuf files with `protoc`, the
protobuf compiler.

```
go get github.com/google/pprof/proto
protoc --decode=perftools.profiles.Profile  $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/pprof/proto/profile.proto --proto_path $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/pprof/proto/
```

The output of this is a bit long, you can view it all here: [output](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jvns/828b5b99d3d7c875175c1e8a1d832161/raw/4effe4f58a0f250093695c6f1675181b93c772c2/profile.pb.txt).

Here's a summary though of what's in this heap profile file! This contains 1 sample. A sample is a
stack trace, and this stack trace has 2 locations: 1 and 2. What are locations 1 and 2? Well they
correspond to mappings 1 and 2, which in turn correspond to filenames 7 and 8.

If we look at the string table, we see that filenames 7 and 8 are these two:

```
string_table: "/home/bork/work/experiments/golang-pprof/leak_simplest"
string_table: "[vdso]"
```

```
sample {
  location_id: 1
  location_id: 2
  value: 1
  value: 34717696
  value: 1
  value: 34717696
}
mapping {
  id: 1
  memory_start: 4194304
  memory_limit: 5066752
  filename: 7
}
mapping {
  id: 2
  memory_start: 140720922800128
  memory_limit: 140720922808320
  filename: 8
}
location {
  id: 1
  mapping_id: 1
  address: 5065747
}
location {
  id: 2
  mapping_id: 1
  address: 4519969
}
string_table: ""

time_nanos: 1506268926947477256
period_type {
  type: 10
  unit: 4
}
period: 524288
```

### pprof files don't always contain function names

One interesting thing about this pprof file `profile.pb` is that it doesn't contain the names of the
functions we're running! But If I run `go tool pprof` on it, it prints out the name of the leaky
function. How did you do that, `go tool pprof`?!

```
go tool pprof -top  profile.pb 
59.59MB of 59.59MB total (  100%)
      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
   59.59MB   100%   100%    59.59MB   100%  main.leakyFunction
         0     0%   100%    59.59MB   100%  runtime.goexit
```

I answered this with strace, obviously -- I straced `go tool pprof` and this is what I saw:

```
5015  openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/bork/pprof/binaries/leak_simplest", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC <unfinished ...>
5015  openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/bork/work/experiments/golang-pprof/leak_simplest", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
```

So it seems that `go tool pprof` noticed that the filename in `profile.pb` was /home/bork/work/experiments/golang-pprof/leak_simplest, and then it just opened up that file on my computer and used that to get the function names. Neat! 

You can also pass the binary to `go tool pprof` like `go tool pprof -out $BINARY_FILE myprofile.pb.gz`. Sometimes pprof files contain function names and
sometimes they don't, I haven't figured out what determines that yet.

### pprof keeps improving!

also I found out that thanks to the great work of people like rakyll, pprof keeps getting better!! For example There's
this pull request https://github.com/google/pprof/pull/188 which is being worked on RIGHT NOW which
adds flamegraph support to the pprof web interface. Flamegraphs are the best thing in the universe
so I'm very excited for that to be available.

If I got someting wrong (I probably did) let me know!!
