I asked on Twitter today what Linux things they would like to know more
about. I thought the replies were really cool so here's a list (many of
them could be discussed on any Unixy OS, some of them are Linux-specific)

* tcp/ip & networking stuff
* what is a port/socket?
* seccomp
* systemd
* IPC (interprocess communication, pipes)
* permissions, setuid, sticky bits, how does chown work
* how the shell uses fork & exec
* how can I make my computer a router?
* process groups, session leaders, shell job control
* memory allocation, how do heaps work, what does malloc do?
* ttys, how do terminals work
* process scheduling
* drivers
* what's the difference between Linux and Unix
* the kernel
* modern X servers
* how does X11 work?
* Linux's zero-copy API (sendfile, splice, tee)
* what is dmesg even doing
* how kernel modules work
* embedded stuff: realtime, GPIO, etc
* btrfs
* QEMU/KVM
* shell redirection
* HAL
* chroot
* filesystems & inodes
* what is RSS, how do I know how much memory my process is using
* iptables
* what is a network interface exactly?
* what is syslog and how does it work?
* how are logs usually organized?
* virtual memory
* BPF
* bootloader, initrd, kernel parameters
* the `ip` command
* what are all the files that are not file files (/dev, stdin, /proc,
  /sys)
* dbus
* sed and awk
* namespaces, cgroups, docker, SELinux, AppArmor
* debuggers
* what's the difference between threads and processes?
* if unix is text-based, how do desktop environments like GNOME fit in?
* kpatch, kgraph, kexec

this is great for so many reasons!

1. I need to draw 11 more drawings about Linux this month and these are
   such great ideas
2. there are many things I don't know on this list and it's a cool
   reminder of how much interesting stuff there still is to learn! A few
   of these I barely even know what they are (dbus, SELinux) or only have a
   pretty sketchy notion (seccomp, how X11 works, many more)
3. it's also a cool reminder of how far I've come -- I at least know
   where to *start* with most of the things on this list, even if I
   definitely could not explain a lot of them in detail without looking
   some stuff up.

Also I sometimes want to remind people that you too could write
interesting
blog posts / drawings on the internet -- for instance "what is dmesg even doing" is
an interesting topic, and not that hard to learn about! (I just
read [dmesg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg) on Wikipedia and now I
know more!)
