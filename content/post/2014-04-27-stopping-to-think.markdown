A while ago I had a bug in my code. I was frustrated because I
couldn't get into a debugger to get more information -- I needed to
know more to understand what was going on! I went home, sad.

On my way back in the morning, I thought about the error message I'd
seen. I realized I didn't need more information! What I had was
enough, and I knew how to fix it. I'd like to remember to step back
and think more often and more quickly.
