I was talking to my awesome friend Amy Hanlon (who is a software engineer at Venmo) about teams!!

She was talking about how she loves her team, and how she tries to make her team an awesome team to work on. I thought the idea that you can make your team awesome as a team **member** (not as a manager!) was really awesome, and I wanted to know how she does it! She told me what she does, and I thought it was so interesting that I wanted to tell you.

### Talk a lot about your work in a public channel

She said that her team has a public (to the company) Slack channel, and that probably 95% of her communication with other people on her team is in that channel. Awesome things about this:

* if you put what you're working on in public, sometimes someone will know a key piece of information that can really help you! Sometimes people will come in and say something that's *not* helpful, but on the balance we think it's worth it to talk in public :)
* if you talk about decisions in public all the time, everyone feels like they know what's involved in the decision making process!
* if you write down what you're struggling with and then write down how you fixed it (even if you fix it yourself) then people can learn from what you found!

### Ask a lot of questions in public

Asking questions in public is a super awesome thing to do! Some questions you can ask of your team:

* How should we be doing X?
* What should we be working on? What should our priorities this year be?
* Is X or Y a better way to do this thing? why?

### Scheduling brainstorming meetings

So the first two things -- talk in public, and ask questions are things that I kinda do, sometimes. But a thing that I *never* do that she talked about is -- scheduling brainstorming meetings with her team! These meetings are pretty small (maybe 4 people). I thought this was cool because setting aside time to talk about how we should do something is something I haven't proactively done a lot, but I think it could be really helpful!

It's really important to come in with an open mind to these brainstorming meetings -- we agreed that we don't think that our initial ideas about a thing are usually right ("I'm probably wrong 70% of the time"). If I'm not attached to the first idea that I come up with, then we can come to better ideas!

### When having a discussion, talk like you might be wrong

Amy reminded me that this is a thing I want to do more!

Suppose we're trying to decide whether to do X or Y. Let's say I think that Y is probably the best thing. There are two ways i could approach this:

1. I think Y is better, explain to me why that is not right 
1. I don't understand yet why X might be better, but probably you have some different knowledge / assumptions than me, can you help me understand?

Coming into a discussion with the attitude "I don't know if I'm right, I'm
ready to change my mind" (and really honestly believing that) has been really
really helpful to me -- a lot of the time I **do** need to change my mind, and
I think it's just a much more productive way.

I do not always manage to do this, but I am trying to get better at it and I
think it's an important part of team-building / working well with others.

### Don't forget you have power over how your team is

This conversation was super inspiring to me because -- I sometimes think of
teams as kind of a static thing, like either "this team is working well
together" or "this team isn't working well together, I don't know how to fix
it". But of course I am a member of the team, and it is partly my job to help
make that team awesome!

I tried to argue to my manager a while ago "i can't make my team more awesome,
I don't know how!". I think I was probably wrong to argue that -- like
making teams more awesome is not trivial but I think it is something I have
done before, at least a little, and something I would like be even better at
in the future.

Most of these things are things I already believe ("admitting you might be
wrong is important", "asking questions in public is helpful"), but want to get
better at putting into practice more often and maybe more loudly :)

(and of course, this post itself is a public question: how do _you_ make
an awesome team? :))
