For the last few days, I've been doing a drawing about Linux on
[my Twitter](https://twitter.com/b0rk) every day. Here they are. (more
at [drawings.jvns.ca](https://drawings.jvns.ca))

It's been really lovely to see the response to these -- some of these
(like /proc) I've known about for quite a while, and it makes me really
happy to hear "wow, I didn't know that! That's really cool!"

I'll try to keep up making one a day for the rest of November.

Drawing these is a fun puzzle -- I can't draw most things (a cat? forget
it!) so I need to figure out which things are within my capabilities (a
lighting bolt? stars? hearts? okay!) and will communicate what I want.

You will probably also notice that I struggle to keep a consistent font
weight :) I'm learning what I think looks good slowly. I've been using
this Android app called "infinite design" to make vector drawings and
they turn out nicer.
