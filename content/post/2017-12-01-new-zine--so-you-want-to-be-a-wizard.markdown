Hello! I have a new zine for you, everyone! "So you want to be a wizard" is now available for free!
Thanks to everyone who paid for early access -- all 200 of you are amazing =)

As usual there is a version to read online and a print version that you can print + fold + staple
and give to your friends. A bunch of folks have told me that they've given this one to newer
developers they work with which makes me happy!

### what the zine is about

Do you want to get **really good** at your job? Me too. This zine is about how I learn new things
about programming! It discusses:

* how to ask awesome questions
* reading the source code
* debugging skills
* how to design software
* and more!


### other news: redesigned my zines page!

As part of posting this, I redesigned https://jvns.ca/zines, the page where all my zines live.
Things there should be better organized and easier to find.

Did you know I've published 8 zines???? I didn't! I was delighted to learn this. This year I made 4
zines, it turns out. Maybe next year I will make 4 zines too!

For a while I was making people download print zines with Gumroad (they were pay-what-you-want).
I've decided that was a failed experiment so now all the links on the page are just normal links to
PDFs. Much easier to use! Yay!
