Danielle Sucher started this [great thread on twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielleSucher/status/573132663336394753)
asking for ideas for what to talk about in 1:1s with your manager. I'm writing
some of them up here so I don't forget.

* What's happening now that I would like to not be happening in a month? (@zmagg)
* Am I having tension with any of my colleagues I want to resolve before it gets worse?
* what are promotions for? where am I relative to that, and what should I be working on?
* or: "This is how I would like promotions to work when they happen. How would I fit in to that if they did?" 
* turn it around: what are *you* thinking about right now? what's your top
priority? what's worrying you about this team?
* Am I happy with my current project?
* Do I feel like I'm learning? Are there things I feel like I'm *not* learning
that I would like to?
* Are there things about the way the team is working together that feel bad to me?
* periodically: where do I want to be with my career?

There's this further list of [101 questions to try](http://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/) that I find really really helpful as an exhaustive grab bag of "oh no I don't know what to talk about give me ideas please!!!".

ideas for how to think about 1:1s more generally:

* If I'd be comfortable talking about it in front of all my coworkers, don't
talk about that. (@zmagg, @mrb_bk)
* It is SO EASY to forget everything that was bothering me when I get to a 1:1.
Keep a shared list throughout the week! TONS of people said that they keep some
kind of list of things to bring up in their 1:1 meetings and I reeeally want to
try it now.
* Keep track of what we've talked about in previous weeks to see if there are
any patterns! Maybe in a shared list, so we can easily see "oh we haven't
talked about careers in 3 months! let's talk about that this week!"
