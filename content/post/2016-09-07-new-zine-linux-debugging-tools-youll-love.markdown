HELLO FRIENDS. I am announcing this everywhere because I'm very excited about
it. I released a new zine today! <a href="http://jvns.ca/debugging-zine.pdf">Read it here</a>! Read all my zine things at [jvns.ca/zines](http://jvns.ca/zines/)!

This zine is about some of my favorite Linux debugging tools, especially tools that I don't think are as well-known as they should be. It covers `strace`, `opensnoop`/`eBPF`, and `dstat`! `netcat`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, and `ngrep`! And there's a whole section on `perf` because perf is the best.

If you don't know what any of those tools I just mentioned are -- PERFECT. You
are who this zine is for!!! Read it and find out why I love them! Also, a lot
of these tools happen to work on OS X :)

I've been really delighted to see that a ton of people have enjoyed & learned
something new from this zine, whether they just started using Linux (!!!) or
have been debugging on Linux for 10 years.

As usual, there are 3 versions. If you print it, you can print as many as you
want! Give them to your friends! Teach them about tcpdump!
