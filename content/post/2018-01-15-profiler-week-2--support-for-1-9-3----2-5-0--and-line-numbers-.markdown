Hello! Week 2 of profiler writing is over! In week 2, I:

* added support for Ruby 1.9.3 (including system Ruby, so it works on Ubuntu 14.04's system Ruby)
* added support for Ruby 2.5.0 (released on Christmas). That's the latest Ruby version!
* added support for getting the line number that the interpreter is currently running (so useful!)
* did a lot of refactoring to improve error handling & reporting. (for example I now have a
  `ProcessEndedError` to check if I failed to get a stack trace because the process). I started
  using the `failure` crate which is great so far.
* added "support" for calling into C extensions (by which I mean: the profiler doesn't crash, it
  just ignores all calls into C extensions)
* refactored my bindgen-generated ruby bindings out into a separate crate (which)
* did [some investigations into whether I should pause the Ruby process I'm profiling with ptrace](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/15/should-i-pause-a-ruby-process-to-collect-its-stack/)

The most exciting update from last week is -- I profiled Rubocop, and it worked!!!!! Rubocop is a
popular linter/static analysis tool for Ruby. I mostly just picked it because it's a standalone
program and it makes a lot of function calls. It was really fun & motivating to see it working!

Here are two graphs I generated by profiling Rubocop! (I generated these basically by running
`./path/to/profiler --file stacks.txt rubocop` and then using brendan gregg's flamegraph tool on the
output stacks.txt)

First, here's what Rubocop looks like when linting when it has a **cache**. (did you know Rubocop
has a cache? I didn't!). If you click to zoom in you'll see that it spends 40% of its time doing
file checksums which is not that surprising!

Here's what Rubocop looks like when it **doesn't** have a cache. Much more complicated! If you look
at the function calls, you'll actually see that the call stacks are kind of weird -- they look like
`on_while -> on_module -> on_while -> on_begin -> on_begin -> on_def -> on_begin...`. I think what's
going on here is that Rubocop is going through the AST of the program it's linting and calling a new
function for each part of the AST. So the call stack of Rubocop basically reflects the structure of
the program it's linting, which is kind of interesting.

### this week's goal: first experimental release!

Since it's working so well (there are lots of problems but it's producing useful output!!), this
week my goal is to release a first experimental release.

The week's release should feature:

* support for seeing which line number your code is spending most of its time on.
* support for generating flame graphs  (maybe?)
* lots of bugs that I don't know about yet =)
* relatively readable code
* a license & contributing guidelines
* a name for the profiler!!!

Back to work!
